# Robert: The Website
The personal website of Robert J. Altman. Currently in early stages.

## Running Locally
To get a copy to work with for yourself, download or clone the repository as you would for any other.

If you are absolutely committed to running this with a server, and are using Windows, I recommend [WampServer](http://www.wampserver.com/en/) to get things running fairly quickly.

## Technologies Used

This is a fairly barebones website, and for ease of setup is based solely on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
